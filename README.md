## üåü Overview

**Avkasa Khmer Zero Space** is a Chrome extension designed to improve the reading and interaction experience with Khmer text on the web. It automatically detects zero-width space characters (U+200B) that can cause problems with text selection, copying, searching, and line breaking, and provides options to either replace them with regular spaces or remove them entirely.

### Problem It Solves

Zero-width spaces in Khmer text can cause:
- Improper text selection and copying
- Failed text searches 
- Broken line wrapping and formatting
- Difficulty for language learners to interact with text

## ‚ú® Features

### Core Functionality
- **Automatic Detection**: Scans all text content for zero-width space characters
- **Flexible Processing**: Choose to inject regular spaces or remove zero-width spaces entirely
- **Real-time Updates**: Processes dynamically loaded content using MutationObserver
- **Performance Optimized**: Uses TreeWalker for efficient DOM traversal with minimal impact

### User Controls
- **Extension Toggle**: Enable/disable the extension completely
- **Auto-run Control**: Toggle automatic processing on page load
- **Processing Mode**: Switch between "inject spaces" and "remove spaces" modes
- **Visual Feedback**: Badge counter shows number of spaces processed
- **Manual Processing**: Option to manually trigger processing

### Smart Processing
- **Reversible Operations**: Tracks original text to allow switching between processing modes
- **Protected Elements**: Skips processing in `<script>`, `<style>`, `<code>`, `<pre>`, and editable elements
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation and error logging
- **Debounced Updates**: Prevents excessive processing during rapid content changes

## üöÄ Installation

### From Chrome Web Store
*(Coming soon)*

### Manual Installation (Development)
1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable "Developer mode" in the top right
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the extension directory
5. The extension will appear in your extensions list

## üìñ Usage

### Getting Started
1. Click the extension icon in your Chrome toolbar
2. The popup will show the current status and controls
3. By default, the extension is enabled with auto-run activated

### Understanding the Interface

#### Status Section
- **Active Indicator**: Cyan pulsing dot shows extension is running
- **Space Counter**: Displays "Spaces fixed: X" for current page

#### Settings Controls

**Enable Extension**
- Master switch to turn the extension on/off
- When disabled, no processing occurs and other controls are greyed out

**Auto-run on page load**
- Controls whether spaces are processed automatically when pages load
- When OFF: Extension only processes spaces when manually triggered
- When ON: Automatically processes all pages as they load

**Inject spaces (vs remove)**
- Controls how zero-width spaces are handled:
  - **ON (Inject)**: Replaces zero-width spaces with regular spaces (U+0020)
  - **OFF (Remove)**: Removes zero-width spaces entirely
- Can be toggled to switch between modes on the current page

### Usage Scenarios

**For Language Learners**
- Keep auto-run enabled and injection mode on for easier text selection and copying
- Use when reading Khmer news sites, social media, or educational content

**For Content Analysis**
- Toggle to removal mode to see the original text structure
- Use manual processing to analyze specific sections

**For Development/Testing**
- Disable auto-run to control when processing occurs
- Switch between inject/remove modes to compare text behavior

## üîß Technical Details

### Architecture
```
Avkasa Khmer Zero Space/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ manifest.json          # Extension configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ service-worker.js      # Background script and settings management  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ content-script.js      # DOM processing and text manipulation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ popup.html            # Extension popup interface
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ popup.js              # Popup logic and communication
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ popup.css             # Cosmic-themed styling
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ icon.png              # Extension icon
```

### Key Components

**Service Worker** (`service-worker.js`)
- Manages extension settings and storage
- Handles communication between components
- Updates badge counter with processing results
- Validates all incoming messages for security

**Content Script** (`content-script.js`)
- Performs actual text processing using TreeWalker
- Implements MutationObserver for dynamic content
- Tracks modified nodes for reversible operations
- Includes comprehensive error handling and validation

**Popup Interface** (`popup.js`, `popup.html`, `popup.css`)
- Provides user controls and status display
- Features cosmic/space-themed design
- Real-time settings synchronization
- Accessible keyboard navigation

### Processing Algorithm

1. **Initial Scan**: On page load (if auto-run enabled)
   - Create TreeWalker to traverse all text nodes
   - Skip protected elements (scripts, styles, code blocks)
   - Identify nodes containing zero-width spaces

2. **Text Processing**: For each node with zero-width spaces
   - Store original content for reversibility
   - Apply selected processing mode (inject/remove)
   - Update DOM with processed text
   - Track changes for future toggles

3. **Dynamic Monitoring**: MutationObserver watches for
   - New content added to page
   - Text modifications
   - Debounced processing to avoid performance issues

### Settings Storage
```javascript
{
  enabled: true,           // Extension on/off
  autoRun: true,          // Auto-process on page load  
  injectSpaces: true      // Inject spaces vs remove
}
```

### Permissions Used
- `activeTab`: Access current tab for processing
- `scripting`: Inject content script into pages
- `storage`: Persist user settings
- `webNavigation`: Monitor page navigation for cleanup

## üõ°Ô∏è Privacy & Security

### Privacy Protection
- **No Data Collection**: Extension does not collect or transmit any user data
- **Local Processing**: All text processing happens locally in the browser
- **No Network Requests**: Extension operates entirely offline
- **Minimal Permissions**: Only requests essential Chrome extension permissions

### Security Measures
- **Input Validation**: All messages and settings are validated
- **Sender Verification**: Messages are verified to come from extension context
- **Content Isolation**: Processing isolated from page scripts
- **Error Boundaries**: Comprehensive error handling prevents crashes

## üé® Design Philosophy

The extension features a **cosmic/space theme** reflecting the "space" concept in "zero-width space":
- Deep space color palette (navy, cyan, cosmic purple)
- Animated status indicators with pulsing effects
- Clean, minimal interface focused on functionality
- High contrast for accessibility

## üîß Development

### Project Structure
The extension follows Chrome Extension Manifest V3 architecture:
- Service worker handles background tasks and settings
- Content script performs DOM manipulation
- Popup provides user interface
- Local storage for settings persistence

### Performance Optimizations
- TreeWalker for efficient DOM traversal
- Debounced mutation observer (100ms delay)
- WeakMap for node tracking to prevent memory leaks
- Conditional processing based on content changes

### Error Handling
- Try-catch blocks around all major operations
- Chrome runtime error checking
- Graceful degradation when APIs unavailable
- Detailed logging for debugging
