# Product Requirements Document: Khmer Zero Width Space Detector & Corrector

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** January 16, 2025  
**Product Name:** Khmer Space Fixer

---

## 1. Executive Summary

The Khmer Space Fixer is a Chrome extension designed to improve the readability and usability of Khmer text on the web by detecting and replacing zero width spaces (ZWSP, U+200B) with regular spaces (U+0020). This addresses common issues with text selection, copying, searching, and line-breaking in Khmer digital content.

## 2. Problem Statement

### 2.1 Current Challenges
- Zero width spaces in Khmer text cause improper line breaks and text wrapping
- Copy-paste operations often preserve ZWSPs, causing formatting issues in destination applications
- Search functionality fails when users search with regular spaces but the text contains ZWSPs
- Many Khmer websites and content creators unknowingly use ZWSPs, degrading user experience

### 2.2 Impact
- Reduced readability of Khmer content online
- Frustration for users trying to copy, search, or interact with Khmer text
- Barriers to digital literacy and content accessibility for Khmer speakers

## 3. Goals & Objectives

### 3.1 Primary Goals
1. **Improve Text Usability**: Enable proper text selection, copying, and searching of Khmer content
2. **Enhance Readability**: Ensure proper line breaking and text flow in Khmer text
3. **Seamless Experience**: Provide automatic detection and correction without user intervention

### 3.2 Success Metrics
- 90% reduction in ZWSP-related text issues on processed pages
- < 100ms impact on page load time
- 80% user satisfaction rate based on Chrome Web Store reviews
- 10,000+ active users within 6 months of launch

## 4. User Personas

## 5. User Stories

### 5.1 Core User Stories
1. As a user, I want ZWSPs automatically replaced when I visit a page so that text behaves normally
2. As a user, I want to see how many spaces were fixed so I know the extension is working
3. As a user, I want to disable the extension on specific sites where I don't want changes
4. As a user, I want the extension to work on dynamically loaded content (infinite scroll, AJAX)
5. As a content creator, I want to check my pages for ZWSP issues before publishing

### 5.2 Advanced User Stories
1. As a power user, I want to manually trigger space fixing on demand
2. As a user, I want to report problematic websites to help improve the extension
3. As a user, I want the option to preview changes before they're applied

## 6. Functional Requirements

### 6.1 Core Features

#### 6.1.1 Automatic ZWSP Detection
- **Description**: Scan all text nodes in the DOM for U+200B characters
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Detects ZWSPs in all text content including dynamically loaded

- **Description**: Replace ZWSPs with regular spaces intelligently
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Only replaces ZWSPs adjacent to Khmer characters (U+1780–U+17FF)
  - Preserves ZWSPs in non-Khmer contexts where they might be intentional
  - Maintains DOM structure and event listeners

#### 6.1.3 Real-time Processing
- **Description**: Process content as it loads and changes
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Initial processing on DOMContentLoaded
  - MutationObserver for dynamic content
  - Debounced processing to avoid performance issues

### 6.2 User Interface

#### 6.2.1 Extension Popup
- **Elements**:
  - ON/OFF toggle switch
  - Space count display ("12 spaces fixed on this page")
  - "Fix Now" manual trigger button
  - Settings link
- **States**:
  - Active (green indicator)
  - Disabled (gray)
  - Working (spinning indicator)

#### 6.2.2 Extension Icon
- **States**:
  - Default: Gray icon
  - Active with fixes: Green with badge showing count
  - Disabled: Gray with slash
  - Error: Red indicator

#### 6.2.3 Options Page
- **Settings**:
  - Auto-fix on page load (default: ON)
  - Show notifications (default: OFF)
  - Website whitelist/blacklist
  - Processing delay slider (0-1000ms)
  - Language selection (Khmer/English)

### 6.3 Notification System
- **Fix Complete**: Brief toast showing "X spaces fixed"
- **Error States**: Non-intrusive error messages
- **First Run**: Welcome message with brief tutorial

### 7.2 Key Algorithms

#### 7.2.1 ZWSP Detection Algorithm
```javascript
// Pseudo-code
function detectAndReplace(node) {
  if (node.nodeType === Node.TEXT_NODE) {
    if (containsKhmerAndZWSP(node.textContent)) {
      node.textContent = replaceZWSP(node.textContent);
    }
  }
}

function containsKhmerAndZWSP(text) {
  return /[\u1780-\u17FF]/.test(text) && /\u200B/.test(text);
}
```
